# chuck-norris-jokes  

A React application that makes API calls to the Chuck Norris open API for jokes.  

Features:  
* Responsive User Interface for desktop and mobile screens using media queries.  
* CSS animation for the page title using keyframes.  
* Async class method that fetches the Chuck Norris Jokes API and displays the returned JSON Object "value" key to the div after the click is registered on the button.  
* Try/Catch block wrapping the async API fetch to grab any errors - displays a text alert to the user that there was an error, and sends the actual error to the console.
